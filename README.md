## Project insight
- Sales surged ~233% from 2013 to 2014 but declined ~29% in 2015.
- Côte de Blaye contributes ~10.3% of total revenue, while low-performing products (e.g., Chocolate, Louisiana Hot Spiced Okra) each contribute <0.3%.
- Top customers (QUICK, SAVEA, ERNSH) generate ~25% each, whereas smaller customers (HUNGO, RATTC) contribute <5% combined.
- United Package makes up ~70% of shipping costs, significantly exceeding Federal Shipping and Speedy Express.
- Total Revenue: $1,354,459 | Shipping Costs: $64,943 | Avg. Revenue/Order: $629.

## Recommendation 
Boost revenue by addressing the 29% sales drop in 2015, focusing on best-sellers, and reassessing products contributing <0.3%. Expand smaller customer accounts (<5% revenue) and reduce United Package’s 70% shipping cost share for better cost efficiency.
